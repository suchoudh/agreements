AISPL Customer Agreement
Last Updated: May 7, 2019

This AISPL Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Service Offerings (as defined below) and is an agreement between Amazon Internet Services Private Limited ("AISPL," "we," "us," or "our"), having its registered office at Ground Floor, Eros Corporate Towers, Nehru Place, New Delhi - 110 019, India, and you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your"). This Agreement takes effect when you click an "I Accept" button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service Offerings (the "Effective Date"). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 14 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement. 
1. Use of the Service Offerings.

1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Service Offerings in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements and Service Terms apply to certain Service Offerings. You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Service Offerings.

1.2 Your Account. To access the Services, you must have an AISPL account associated with a valid email address and a valid form of payment. Unless explicitly permitted by the Service Terms, you will only create one account per email address.

1.3 Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may be used by you at your election. Third-Party Content is governed by this Agreement and, if applicable, separate terms and conditions accompanying such Third-Party Content, which terms and conditions may include separate fees and charges.
2. Changes.

2.1 To the Service Offerings. We or our affiliates may change or discontinue any or all of the Service Offerings or change or remove functionality of any or all of the Service Offerings from time to time. We will notify you of any material change to or discontinuation of the Service Offerings.

2.2 To the APIs. We or our affiliates may change or discontinue any APIs for the Services from time to time. For any discontinuation of or material change to an API for a Service, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the previous version of such API for 12 months after the change or discontinuation (except if doing so (a) would pose a security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would cause us to violate the law or requests of governmental entities).

2.3 To the Service Level Agreements. We may change, discontinue or add Service Level Agreements from time to time in accordance with Section 12.
3. Security and Data Privacy.

3.1 AISPL Security. Without limiting Section 10 or your obligations under Section 4.2, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.

3.2 Data Privacy. You may specify the AWS regions in which Your Content will be stored. You consent to the storage of Your Content in, and transfer of Your Content into, the AWS regions you select. We will not access or use Your Content except as necessary to maintain or provide the Service Offerings, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. We will not (a) disclose Your Content to any government or third party or (b) subject to Section 3.3, move Your Content from the AWS regions selected by you; except in each case as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Unless it would violate the law or a binding order of a governmental body, we will give you notice of any legal requirement or order referred to in this Section 3.2. We will only use your Account Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy, and you consent to such usage. The Privacy Policy does not apply to Your Content.

3.3 Service Attributes. To provide billing and administration services, we may process Service Attributes in the AWS region(s) where you use the Service Offerings and the AWS regions in the United States. To provide you with support services initiated by you and investigate fraud, abuse or violations of this Agreement, we may process Service Attributes where we maintain our support and investigation personnel.
4. Your Responsibilities.

4.1 Your Accounts. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account.

4.2 Your Content. You will ensure that Your Content and your and End Users’ use of Your Content or the Service Offerings will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law. You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of Your Content.

4.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Service Offerings and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content.

4.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys. AWS log-in credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only and you will not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.

4.5 End Users. You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Service Offerings. You are responsible for End Users’ use of Your Content and the Service Offerings. You will ensure that all End Users comply with your obligations under this Agreement and that the terms of your agreement with each End User are consistent with this Agreement. If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the Service Offerings by such End User. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services.
5. Fees and Payment.

5.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. We will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax laws. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as described on the Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff, or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding unless required by law. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments. You acknowledge that AISPL may display the applicable fees and charges for the Service Offerings on the Site in USD (or such other currency as AISPL may deem fit). However, AISPL will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice ("INR Equivalent Fees"). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.

5.2 Taxes. All fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes ("Taxes") that AISPL is legally obligated to charge under the applicable laws. For the purpose of this clause, local indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes the Central Goods and Services Tax ("Central Tax"), the State Goods and Services Tax ("State Tax"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax ("UT Tax"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax ("Integrated Tax") as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by AISPL will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. AISPL may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN ("GST Information") in order for AISPL to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable AISPL to correct the GST tax invoice. AISPL will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.
6. Temporary Suspension.
